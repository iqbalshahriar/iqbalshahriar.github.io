I am a CS PhD Candidate at the University of South Carolina. 

## Research Interests
I am interested to pursue research in the area of systems performance, deep learning compilers, distributed systems, and causal inference.

## Current Status
I am actively looking for **Post-doctoral** and **Research Scientist** postions. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me at miqbal@email.sc.edu
